#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration


* Installation

1) Backup your current Emacs config: ~mv ~/.emacs.d{,.bak}~
2) Clone this repo to replace it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://gitlab.com/tspub/lisp/emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

3) Open Emacs...
4) Wait for all the packages declared [[file:use.el][here]], to download and install...
5) ...Profit!

*N.B.* If you don't want to wait for all the packages to download or just want
a more vanilla setup, please comment out the following line in [[file:init.el][init.el]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load (concat user-emacs-directory "use")) ;; comment for no 3rd party packages
#+end_src>

* Design

- All built-in Emacs configuration lives in [[file:site-lisp/][site-lisp]].
- All third party packages are setup using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], in [[file:use.el][use.el]].
