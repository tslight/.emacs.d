#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration

This branch contains a much simpler config with no 3rd party packages.

Useful if for some reason [[https://melpa.org/][Melpa]] is down at exactly the wrong moment, and I need
Emacs to be more useful than the default settings.

* Installation

1) Backup your current Emacs config: ~mv ~/.emacs.d{,.bak}~
2) Clone this repo to replace it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://gitlab.com/tspub/lisp/emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

3) Open Emacs...
4) ...Profit!
